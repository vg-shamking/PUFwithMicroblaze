## Project done in Xilinx Vivado written in Verilog and VHDL languages.
## Subject: "Phisically unclonable function (PUF) with Microblaze in Xilinx Vivado"
###### A physical unclonable function, or PUF, is a physical object that for a given input and conditions (challenge), provides a physically-defined "digital fingerprint" output (response) that serves as a unique identifier, most often for a semiconductor device such as a microprocessor. PUFs are most often based on unique physical variations which occur naturally during semiconductor manufacturing. A PUF is a physical entity embodied in a physical structure. Today, PUFs are usually implemented in integrated circuits and are typically used in applications with high security requirements, more specifically cryptography.
