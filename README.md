# Project done in Xilinx Vivado written in Verilog and VHDL languages as an exam project in WSiZ "Copernicus"

# Subject: "Phisically unclonable function (PUF) with Microblaze in Xilinx Vivado"

##### A physical unclonable function, or PUF, is a physical object that for a given input and conditions (challenge), provides a physically-defined "digital fingerprint" output (response) that serves as a unique identifier, most often for a semi-conductor device such as a microprocessor. PUFs are most often based on unique physical variations which occur naturally during semiconductor manufacturing. PUFs are a physical entity embodied in a physical structure. Today, PUFs are usually implemented in integrated circuits and are typically used in applications with high security requirements, more specifically cryptography.
